# Binary Search Tree - Array Representaion

Array representation of BST is one of the most underrated concepts of data structures. Partly due to the demerits it may have but also partly due to lack of resources about it.
<br>So, to increase resources about the concepts behind the said topic, I have created a youtube video (see from <a href= "https://youtu.be/ZBN6QoKgSwA">here</a>) with the source code available for easy access to everyone who wishes to learn.
Along with it, to not make it so simple, the code also deals with printing the BST in decreasing order for general cases.

Keep learning!!
